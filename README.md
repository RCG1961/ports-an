Port scanning with Javascript

The index.html shows how it can be used.
Further notes about the implementation can be
found in portscanner.js (use the source, Luke).

The portscanning function is taken from
http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/javascript-port-scanner/
written by Petko Petkov.

It needs jquery.

The preview of the index.html is not working anymore, don't know why and I will not investigate:
